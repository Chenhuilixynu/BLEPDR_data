The Bluetooth array and PDR indoor positioning supplementary open data set (BLEPDR_data) were established. Data includes non-dynamic data and dynamic data. The non-dynamic data collection site was the 5th floor of China Surveying and Mapping Building, and a total of 737 data were recorded, 550 of which were selected for algorithm verification. The location of dynamic data collection is the conference room and corridor on the third floor of the Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping. A total of 256 data were recorded for algorithm validation. The non-dynamic data provided the raw iq data. The data set contains three scenarios: elevator hall, conference room, and corridor. Nine positioning base stations were installed in the dynamic experiment. The location and CAD drawings of these base stations are provided. The data set can be used to compare the comparative analysis of positioning algorithms based on Bluetooth array and the accuracy verification of Kalman filter algorithms.
